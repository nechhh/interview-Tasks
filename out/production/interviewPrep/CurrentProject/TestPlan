TEST PLAN:
  Document that describes software testing scope and activities. Basis for formally testing any software/product in a
  project.
  •It allows you to structure your efforts and see a bigger picture.(Never build a house without plan!)

An Agile Test Plan is a very important document because it gives your Quality Assurance (QA) team the ability to have all
 high-level scenarios(test cases), business requirements and estimates in one place. Your QA Analyst or Agile Tester should fill out
  an Agile Test Plan during each sprint planning event

Image result for when do we need write test plan
A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and
 resources required to perform testing for a software product. Test Plan helps us determine the effort needed to
  validate the quality of the application under test

TEST LEAD OR QA MANAGER IS RESPONSIBLE MAKE TEST PLAN;
    •what to test, How to test, When to test, Who will test

    TEST PLAN EXAMPLE;

     -Overview;
     -Scope;
     -Impact
     -Acceptance Criteria
     -Epic
     -design doc
     -Environment
     -High Level Test Scenarios
      •Verify if the system allows modifying the existing policy for the new addition of a new coverage or plan.
      •Verify if the system is able to modify or update the costumer's personal detail.

TEST STRATEGY;
 •Test Strategy is a critical step in making a Test Plan in Software Testing. A Test Strategy document,
      is a high-level document, which is usually developed by PO.

 1.TEST SCOPE;
   •Before the start of any test activity, scope of the testing should be known.

   Defining the scope of your testing project is very important for all stakeholders. A precise scope helps you
        •Give everyone a confidence & accurate information of the testing you are doing.
        •All project members will have a clear understanding about what is tested and what is not.

   FOREX;
        In scope items;Functional Testing, API Testing.
        Out of scope items;Database Testing, hardware & any other external interfaces.

! Problem scenario;
   the costumer wants you test her API. But the project budget does not permit to do so.such a case what will you do ?

     Well,is such case you need to convince the customer that API Testing is extra work and will consume significant
     resources. tell her if API Testing is included in-scope the budget will increase by XYZ amount.

  2. Create Test Logistics;
      •Who will test ?
                -You may not know exact names of the tester who will test, but the type of tester can be defined.

      •When will the test occur ?
                -you will start to test when you have all required items shown in following figure.

                 Test specs and requirement document+Human resources+Test environment=ready to test.

 3. Define Test Objective;
     The objective of the testing is finding as many software defects as possible; ensure that the software under test
      is bug free before release.

 4) Define Test Criteria;

       Suspension Criteria;Test Plan Example: If your team members report that there are 40% of test cases failed, you
        should suspend testing until the development team fixes all the failed cases.

 6) Plan Test Environment;










   Component of test Strategy;

   •Scope and Objectives
   •Roles and responsibilities
   •Communication and status reporting
   •Industry standards to follow
   •Test automation and tools
   •Defect reporting and tracing
========================================================================================================================
 Test Case;

  It is a set of action to execute to check a functionality.

  •Test Case ID
  •Test data
  •Test Description
  •Expected Result
  •Actual Result
  •Pass or Fail

========================================================================================================================
? How can you test a product without any information about it ?

 •The answer is impossible. You must learn a product thoroughly before testing it.
 •You should research clients and the end users to know their needs and expectations from the app.
