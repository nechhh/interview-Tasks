1. What is the current sprint you are working on

    -Answer will depend on how long your sprints are and how long have you been on
    that poject with the company.

      -Letâ€™s say if you say you are with the company for 1 year and you join the project at
       sprint 5 and your sprints are 2 weeks long. Your sprint can be 29.
==============================================================================================================
2. What type of tests have you automated? How many test cases have you automated
per day? When do you do automation in your sprint?

 -Mostly I have automated functional regression tests (including smoke and regression,database and API testing)
  and we do automation of user stories.
  Whenever developers done with development of the user story and code is deployed
  to a QA environment,I test the user story manually and then do automation.

  -5-7 User Stories per Sprint(it also depends on user story size)
  ? how do you do automation in your company ?

==============================================================================================================
3. What is smoke testing and how do you run it in your project? How many test cases
are there and how often do you perform smoke testing?

SMOKE TEST:
       Smoke test is a process where the software build is deployed the QA environment and
        is verified to ensure the stability of the app.All the critical functionalities would be put to test here.

        A major benefit of smoke test is that it provides quick feedback.In simple terms,We verifying whether the important
        features are working.
        -We have a dedicated pipeline for our smoke test within our jenkins and since Jenkins is a wab based app.
        Anyone can use it by using its URL.
        We provide the following arguments during the initial configuration.

        -whenever there is a code push our smoke test pipeline is automatically triggered.
        -In my smoke suite I have around 18 scenarios that are executed within 12-15 mins.
        -we runs smoke test daily to check the healt of our app.
==============================================================================================================
4. What is regression testing and how do you run it in your project? How many test
cases are there and how often do you perform regression testing? How long does
your regression suite run?

   REGRESSION TESTING;
        it is a type of testing where testers verify the previous functionality of  the app is working fine and
        the new changes have not introduced any new bugs.

         When we are going to performed regression testing;
         -Bug fix
         -New feature added
         -Changes in existing feature
         -Performance issue fix
         -In my current job every 2 week we have release night.we work overtime this day.and we have dinner with team

5.Tell me about your framework

 Let me elaborate on the structure of my framework.

 Cucumber:
    Maven:
       First we have maven project that helps us build project structure,manage project dependencies and execute automated scripts.
       In the pom file we adda all dependencies that are required for project (Cucumber,Junit ,JDBC,Rest Assured etc.)

    Test Runner:
        It  is the execution point of our framework.In runner class using cucumber options we specify configurations of our tests.
        We have seperate smoke,regression and API JUnit runner classes.
